# qpm — Quiet Pacman

> **Made for minimalism.**

`qpm` is a minimalist wrapper for Arch Linux’s `pacman`, built to streamline package management with quiet, clean output. No clutter, no noise — just packages.

> ✨ *0.0.1 (Cheers)* — first version, named after how I felt building it.

## Features

* 🛠 Install, remove, and update packages quietly
* 📆 Install/remove packages from `.qpm` files (space or newline format)
* 🧘 Minimal terminal output — no distractions
* 🔀 Use `--yay` to switch to `yay` for AUR support
* 🤪 `--out` flag to show raw pacman/yay output (debugging)

## .qpm Files

**Space-separated**

```
cmatrix cowsay fastfetch btop
```

```
cmatrix
cowsay
fastfetch
btop
```

Then install them with:
